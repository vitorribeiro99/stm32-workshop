# STM32 Workshop

This repository has all the content of the STM32 workshop. All slides and code.

The repo is divided into three parts:

- Slides
- Code
- Documentation

### Slides

Here you can find all the presentations given through the in-person sessions

### Code

In this directory you will find all the examples that appear in the slides

### Documentation

All documentation used to create this course, you may want to take a look at it
in some cases of doubt.

## Content

The topics taught in the course are:

- Create a project
- HAL API
- Debug on-chip
- GPIO
- UART
- Interrupts and NVIC
- Clocks and Clock Tree
- Timers
- ADC
- DAC

## Set up of the machine and Installation of the tools

All the steps required to accomplish the installation of the tools are in
the session 0 slides.

However, the installation presented only works on Windows OS, if you want to
work in other OS (like macOS or Linux) you can install a Virtual Machine with
Windows OS, withal that those Virtual Machine must be capable of interact with
Serial Port (RS232) and USB (version 2.0 at least). If a Virtual Machine isn't
a solution for you, you can install a different set of tools, our
recommendation, in that case, is to use the STM32CubeIDE. You can find an
installation tutorial [here](https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/user_manual/group1/31/8b/03/27/25/c5/4d/ae/DM00603964/files/DM00603964.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.DM00603964.pdf)

Keep in mind that the projects are made to ARM Keil, so if you install another
toolset you should make the needed changes to make the code work.

### Requirements

In order to get the most profit over the course you should have:

- Computer with Windows OS (or other like told previously)
- STM32 development board (STM32 Nucleo-F767ZI preferably)
- Basic knowledge about embedded systems
- Know embedded C programming language

## Usage and Purpose

The purpose of all this content is to help the students of MIEEEIC to learn
the basics of STM32 development. It is intended that at the end of the planned
sessions the students shuld have enough curiosity to continue learning.

All the code given may be used without asking for authorization, nonetheless,
using it for evaluation purposes is not recommended and will
not contribute to the main purpose of this curse: "helping people to learn".
